# Strassen-Algorithm
**Individual project for the Uppsala University course High Performance Programming, 10 ECTS (1TD062), Q1 of 2026, implementing Strassens algorithm along with a basic, main file and some basic matrix algebra functions.**

**Project instructions are as follows:**

  The project must involve implementation of an algorithm in C, serial code optimization and parallelization either with Pthreads or OpenMP. [...]
  The requirements on the report is that it is informal presenting the problem and the results with reflections. You should show that you fulfill the learning outcomes of the course:
  
  implement computational algorithms to efficient C-code for modern computer architectures,
  use tools for performance optimisation and debugging,
  propose and implement efficient performance optimisations,
  identify factors that restrict parallelism in an algorithm or a program,
  present written performance analysis in a clear and explicit way.
  Submit the report separately as a PDF-file and then the code in a tar-file. No other specific format is required.
